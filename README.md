# Investigating the effects of parental divorce on Canadians and their marital qualities 
In this paper, we implement an ordinary least squares regressions (OLS) model to investigate the effects of parental divorce on Canadians based on the 2017 General Social Survey (GSS).

## Note on file structure
'inputs' folder is where the raw data files should go. The data file that was used in this study was retrieved from the 2017 (Cycle 31) General Social Survey (GSS) from Statistics Canada. 

'scripts' folder contains the R scripts that we used to clean the datasets.

'outputs' is where anything that we created goes. This includes our paper and the Rmd file used to generate the paper, as well as the cleaned data files. 

## Suggested steps for recreating our report
1. Download the raw data file as provided in the 'inputs' folder. Alternvatively, ensure any data taken from the 2017 (Cycle 31) General Social Survey (GSS) from Statistics Canada, correspond to the dates considered in the paper. 
2. Run the data cleaning script that is provided in the 'scripts' folder. In order for the scripts to run correctly, ensure that the filepath and file names in your code match with the ones on your system.
3. Ensure that the cleaned data files from step 2 are placed in the "outputs" folder.
4. In the "outputs" folder, you will find the the .Rmd file ('PS3_RMarkdown.Rmd') which should be ran to generate the report.
